# Record-Collection-Organizer

I needed to organize my record collection, and I didn't feel like doing it manually, so I wrote this program. 

This program reads a file that contains information about albums, and creates objects with them that are sorted into ArrayLists. The ArrayLists are then sorted by Genre, Artist, Year, and Album name.

This program supports the genres: Country, Electronic, Folk, Hip-Hop, Jazz, Metal, Orchestral, OST, Pop, Punk, R&B, Rock, as well as having a seperate file for singles.

The defines have the syntax:

	{Artist Name},{Genre}:
	   {Album Name},{Year Released}

This program is a little bit old, so my code isn't the greatest. 

If you feel like rewriting this to use a .csv file or adding in more genres, etc. feel free to do so :-)
